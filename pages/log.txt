While the issues raised below are relevant worldwide, the comments regarding legal standing below are specific to UK law, and readers should not assume they are applicable to other jurisdictions. There will however be similarities in these other jurisdictions. \n\nCopyright law, many claim, states that anyone creating and recording in any manner a new creative work (i.e., one not copied from elsewhere) is automatically granted copyright protection over that work. This protection gives the owner the right to authorise, or to refuse to authorise, certain 'restricted acts' by any third party; these acts include copying, adaptation of the work, redissemination (for instance publishing it on the Web), all, or a\n\"substantial part\" of the original copyright work, as well as translation of the work into other languages. \n\nIn practice, copyright law is more complex than stated above. Simple facts (which includes much data) are not subject to copyright, and nor are short sentences. What is classified as either a fact or a short sentence remains ambiguous and controversial, and is often only resolved by means of a court case. A recent European Court case2 confirmed that a sentence of 11 words was capable of being protected by copyright; though this does not imply that all similar sentences will be protected by copyright. \n\nAs the act of copying is considered to infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of copyright owners, this leads to some legal ambiguity around the process of TDM. Some processes of TDM, from a PDF, may require the production of a temporary interstitial file. Whether those files are \"legal\" is focus of debate between those who support or oppose wider TDM use. Is an interstitial file the equivalent of a temporary file from Adobe Acrobat Reader? Or is it a derived work and therefore a breach of copyright? \n\nThese questions are significant. As the majority of the academic literature currently exists under copyright, without licenses relinquishing rights, we can assume much of the literature that would be used for TDM would be under copyright. While there are some so-called exceptions to copyright3, which permit third parties to copy, or carry out restricted acts, without having to pay or having to request permission and although such exceptions in some countries such as the United States, are considered sufficient to allow for content mining, researchers may be reluctant to test the law which is not well defined for these activities. In the UK, until a recent change to copyright law, there were numerous copyright exceptions, however the wording of these were either ambiguous or arguably did not apply to TDM. \n\nThis results in a legal barrier, which can prevent risk-averse researchers (or their institutions) from relying upon copyright exceptions to carry out their research, and instead approaching publishers (as most of the works they wanted to use were indeed owned by publishers) for permission to TDM for a particular project for a particular pre-defined question. Sometimes this permission would be readily granted at no charge, but many publishers wanted unreasonably high fees and/or placed such restrictions on what could be done with their materials and/or took an extremely long time to decide how to respond, so that in practice the permission was not obtainable. There are some notable exceptions, such as Springer and The Royal Society, that have taken a generous approach to granting permissions to researchers to undertake TDM, but alas they are still a minority. In any case, TDM researchers have to approach multiple publishers, each of whom have different attitudes, conditions, and speed of response to such requests. This is very costly to a researcher, and would have significant impact upon the take-up of TDM as a practice, or (so anecdotes tell us) inhibit academics from sharing the outputs of their research using TDM, therefore limiting the potential benefits this technology enables."},"name":{"value":"root"}}|{"id":{"value":"form1_table3_tr1_td1_table5_tr1_td1_table1_tr1_td2"},"start":{"value":1138},"end":{"value":5377},"azione":{"value":"I"},"object":{"value":"http://purl.org/spar/deo/Introduction"},"email":{"value":"a%40a.a"},"at":{"value":"30/1/2016"},"label":{"value":"Introduzione"},"subject":{"value":"ver1"},"predicate":{"value":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/semiotics.owl#denotes"},"bLabel":{"value":""},"key":{"value":"The ideas of textual or data analysis go back hundreds if not thousands of years. Originally carried out manually textual and data analysis has long been a tool which has enabled new insights to be drawn from text and data corpora. \n\nThe development of the computer enabled the automation of the processes involved, including information retrieval, searching, indexing, reading and analysis of literature that exists in a digital format. These automated processes, often referred to as text and data mining (TDM), have many everyday uses, including the underlying technology behind Internet search engines and targeted advertising, a variety of ways to access library collections, and sentiment. There are many potential uses for TDM within academia, including within biomedical, biological and chemical research where genes, species names, chemical compounds, and statistical significances can all be extracted. Clark (2012) provides a useful introduction to the topic.\n\nAlthough the computer-based techniques date back to the early 1980s, unsurprisingly, the development of TDM as a field has relied heavily upon improvements in computational hardware, including lowered memory and CPU costs, development of high speed networks, as well as innovations in software, including natural language processing techniques, and optical character recognition. \n\nAny content undergoing analysis has to exist in what is termed a 'machine readable format', one of several formats known as XML or JSON that allow a computer to read and understand the information contained. PDFs, often the lingua franca of academic journals, while able to present standardized formats for humans to read, are not machine readable, and as such for TDM purposes, this work must be transferred into a different digital form (Hobbs, et al., 1982). That form is often custom and specific to the research question being asked and the most appropriate tools to answer that question. \n\nThere is, unsurprisingly, a vast literature describing research into, and applications of, TDM, as well as the technical challenges. However, to date relatively little has been written on the political, social and legal barriers involved. The primary legal issue associated with TDM relates to copyright, database rights and licensing4, to which there are political solutions. The lack of awareness, and relative technological gap between many TDM tools and the skills of many academics also acts as a barrier. \n\nDespite the existence of technological and legal barriers, there has been a growth in interest in TDM over recent years; including the creation of the first publicly funded text-mining centre, the National Centre for Text Mining in Manchester in 2004, TDM being the subject of various reports, including a 2012 JISC report (McDonald and Kelly, 2012) and the development of Google Ngram.  This growth in interest is not simply a reflection of the improvements in techniques and technologies. There has been recognition that TDM technologies provide broad economic and societal opportunities, including \"increased researcher efficiency; unlocking hidden information and developing new knowledge; exploring new horizons; improved research and evidence base; and improving the research process and quality.\" (McDonald and Kelly, 2012)\n\nHowever, for the potential benefits of TDM to be unlocked, a number of non- technological barriers need to be overcome. These include legal uncertainty resulting from complicated copyright, database rights and licensing, the fact that some publishers are not currently embracing the opportunities TDM offers the academic community, and a lack of awareness and technological skills among many academics with respect to TDM. These are not the only barriers to the uptake of TDM; however, topics such as ethical and privacy issues for medical data, the fact that data quality can be poor, e.g., data held in different systems, missing, corrupted, non-standardised data;  the fact that sometimes patterns emerge which are in fact due to random fluctuations; and the fact that setting up a sophisticated TDM facility involves substantial investment in IT systems, building databanks and recruiting expertise are not considered further in this paper."},"name":{"value":"root"}}
