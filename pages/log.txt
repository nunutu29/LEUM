Datasets empower the evaluation of recommender systems by enabling that researchers evaluate their systems with the same data. Datasets are available in several recommendation domains, including movies, music, and baby names. \n\nIn this paper, we present the architecture of Docear's research paper recommender system. In addition, we present four datasets containing information about a large corpus of research articles, and Docear's users, their mind-maps, and the recommendations they received. By publishing the recommender system's architecture and datasets, we pursue three goals.\n\nFirst, we want researchers to be able to understand, validate, and reproduce our research on Docear's recommender system [4-10]: In our previous papers, we could often not go into detail of the recommender system due to spacial restrictions. This paper gives the information on Docear's recommender system that is necessary to allow the re-implementation of our approaches and to reproduce our findings.\n\nSecond, we want to support researchers when building their own research paper recommender systems. Docear's architecture and datasets ease the process of designing one's own system, estimating the required development times, determining the required hardware resources to run the system, and crawling full-text papers to use as recommendation candidates.\n\nThird, we want to provide real-world data to researchers who have no access to such data. This is of particular importance, since the majority of researchers in the field of research paper recommender systems have no access to real-world recommender systems [11]. Our datasets allow analyses beyond the analyses we have already published, for instance to evaluate collaborative filtering algorithms, perform citation analysis, or explore the use of reference managers. \n\nThis paper will present related work, provide a general overview of Docear and its recommender system, introduce the architecture, and present the datasets."},"name":{"value":"Ion Ursachi"}}
