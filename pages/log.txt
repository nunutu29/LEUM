For the shake of space economy, in the context of this paper we have only focused on a single funding scheme, namely the FP7-ICT funding category. We have chosen this particular funding scheme because of its plurality in subject areas and its huge number of funded projects (and therefore respective publications). Furthermore, the research areas of this scheme are well represented by the adopted supervised taxonomy (arXiv).\n\nFor comparison purposes, we are also presenting the corresponding visualization results for two additional datasets of particular domain-specific research areas:\n\n\nthe European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO),  organized by the European Association for Signal Processing (EURASIP). This is a rather domain-specific and limited (in terms of interdisciplinary content) dataset. We have selected to present the visualizations of this set as a case of low-interdisciplinarity.\n\n\ta small corpus of publications related to cognitive computation. This is a research area of high interdisciplinarity, as it covers many areas from psychology, mathematics and machine learning.\n\nFigures 2, 3 and 4 present the chord diagrams for the ICT, EUSIPCO and Cognitive Computation corpora respectively. The content classes are organized in a circular layout and links between them correspond to (normalized) inter-class similarities. Different colors correspond to different arXiv superclasses (e.g. Computer Science). A complete set of (clearer and interactive) visualizations can be found here. The highest interdisciplinarity between the classes of the Cognitive Computation dataset is obvious (as expected) from the existence of many inter-class links. On the other hands, the EUSIPCO dataset leads to a more non-interdisciplinary representation."},"name":{"value":"Ion Ursachi"}}
